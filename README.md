🌿 Leaves Subsystem: Project Overview
This subsystem manages the complete employee time-off and leave lifecycle within the HR system. It handles rules, requests, and integration with Payroll and Time Management.

Core Functionality

Policy Definition: Configures rules for every leave type (e.g., Annual, Sick), including eligibility, accrual rates, and max carry-over caps.


Request Workflow: Manages employee self-service submissions through a mandatory multi-level approval chain (Manager → HR).


Automatic Synchronization (Integration): Upon final approval, the system automatically updates employee leave balances and syncs data with Payroll (for adjustments/encashment) and Time Management (to block attendance)
